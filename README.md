<i>Department Policy on Academic Dishonesty</i>

Copying all or part of another person's work or using reference materials not specifically allowed are forms of cheating that will not be tolerated at UC Berkeley and in EECS. If we find that you were involved in an incident of cheating, your instructor will notify you. Below you will find the departmental policy on academic dishonesty. For more information, refer to the Center for Student Conduct Academic Integrity web page.

1.The instructor may take actions including:
Requiring repetition of the course work

2.Assigning an F grade or a "zero" grade to the subject work, and, for serious offenses, assigning an F grade to the course. The recommended action for cheating on examinations, term papers or projects is assigning an F grade to the course.

3.The instructor must document and inform the student and Department Chair, in writing, of the incident, the action taken, if any, and the right of the student to appeal to the Chair of the Department Grievance Committee the actions taken by the instructor or to have the matter resolved by Student Judicial Affairs.

4.The instructor must retain copies of any written evidence or observation notes.

5.The Department Chair must inform Student Judicial Affairs of the incident in both cases where the matter was resolved between the instructor and student as well as cases referred to Student Judicial Affairs to investigate and resolve.

6.Student Judicial Affairs offers the student both the opportunity to resolve the incident informally or by a formal hearing process in determining whether there has been a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and any sanctions that may follow.

7.The Department will recommend that students involved in a second incident of cheating be dismissed from the University.

8.Courses for which academic dishonesty has been verified by established campus procedures may not be dropped from the record. Grades for such courses will be reinstated to the record when dishonesty is verified subsequent to a drop transaction.
