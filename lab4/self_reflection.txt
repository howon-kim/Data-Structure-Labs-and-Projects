All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: Method wrapindex is very clever and it would make my code more condense and easier to read.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I implement the method to make deque to array from first to last, I guess it may be useful when I implement this as a big library.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: There is a method called iterateArray to make new Array to sort the deque from the first to last, but I think it may useless in this deque structure and project.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I learned about static final to save the constant value of the initial deque size.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I would know to use modulos operator to wrapping the index.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would make constant variable to store the initial deque size.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: This one looks similar with staff's solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I do not use that much edge case like ArrayDeque.
